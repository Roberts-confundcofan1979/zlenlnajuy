Just got out of Revelations and man, what a ride. My head’s still spinning, like I just got off the world’s oldest rollercoaster. Bits of popcorn still stuck to my shirt—seriously, those seats must’ve been designed by someone who hated spines. Like, halfway through, I just wished I was a turtle so I could carry my own comfy shell around. 

The  , though. I mean, it starts with this wild explosion—was it space, was it underwater? My brain can barely catch up. And then there's that dude with the weird hat (why hats in sci-fi are always weird?). His face, can't even remember it, but his voice was like thunder mashed with cotton candy, weird but somehow fits perfectly. 

> There's this scene—dunno if I was dreaming, or if the beans in the burrito kicked in—where the protagonist just floats amidst floating cats and jelly. Ridiculous, stupidly beautiful. Like the inside of a fever dream mixed with a cat meme generator. 

Someone four rows back kept opening bags. Crunch, crunch, and all I could think about, besides how the villain reminded me of my grumpy Uncle Lou, was how on earth they got away with 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 THAT line about destiny and mushrooms. Who wrote this script? It’s like poetry from a vending machine.

Oh, and then the climax, of course. Everyone knows. Social media's been shouting for weeks=but somehow it still hit me like a rogue wave—a massive cinematic goulash hitting the senses. I swear the guys behind me were crying—I mean, one was definitely snoring, but the other? He hit the emotion jackpot or something?

> Oh! Angie was asking if she should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 in theaters—is it worth the surprise? I'd say, the confusing wave of revelations and nachos definitely worth a trip out. Bring your own cushion, though.

My head’s still a muddle—random scenes dancing on the edge of thought but slipping away like soap in the shower. Going home and logging this into the brain like a dusty shelf. Speaking of dust, gotta clean the lobby later. Why do theaters always smell like ancient socks? Code, right.
